                    <p>Its no small feat to appease an angry customer, but recognizing the stressful situation, rude
                        tone of a customer,
                        or just the sense of dread helping the "troublesome one" is potentally the exact way I myself would
                        react has helped me to respond
                        positively. I might act that way, feel that way, walk, talk, or even cough that way, if I grew up and
                        experienced what they did or what they are currently going through, and with that I must
                        choose to love as Christ would. Because he <b>STILL</b> loves me when I treat him how others
                        treat me.
